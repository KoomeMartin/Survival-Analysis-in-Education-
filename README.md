## üéì Survival Analysis in Education

## CASE STUDY
### INVESTIGATING STUDENT DROP OUT RATES USING A TIME DEPENDENT COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL AT THE FACULTY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN MULTIMEDIA UNIVERSITY OF KENYA

This project investigates the **student dropout rates in Kenyan universities** using **Survival Analysis** techniques, with a specific focus on STEM programs. The aim is to understand when and why students leave before completing their studies, and to identify key demographic and academic factors that influence dropout risk.

### üîç Objectives

* Estimate student survival probabilities over a 4-year period.
* Identify high-risk dropout periods and vulnerable groups.
* Evaluate the effects of variables like gender, academic performance, and department using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox Proportional Hazards models.
* Compare dropout risks between groups (e.g., male vs female) using the Log-rank test.

### üìä Methodology

* **Kaplan-Meier Estimation** for visualizing survival probabilities.
* **Log-rank tests** for comparing survival distributions.
* **Cox Proportional Hazards model** for multivariate regression analysis.

### üß† Key Findings

* The 3rd year is a critical dropout period across most departments.
* Male students exhibited slightly higher dropout risks than females.
* Students with supplementary exams or lower grades were at significantly higher risk.
* Institutional support and resilience mechanisms appear to mitigate some combined dropout effects.

### üí° Recommendations

* Tailored academic support for low-performing students.
* Restructuring of the work-study program to support learning outcomes.
* Career engagement events and university-industry partnerships to improve relevance and job readiness.


### üìå Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, Lifelines, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Statistical modeling (Kaplan-Meier, CoxPH, Log-rank)
